git-site
====================================================================================================

A custom Git command to launch the home page for the current project. This command works with both
HTTPS and GIT protocols. This command presumes that your
project home page matches the URL for your remote named `origin` (the default).
Tested on GitHub and GitLab projects on Windows, but it should work on other platforms.

To use this script, put the `git-site` BASH script somewhere on your command path, and run the
command `git site` (without the hyphen) from within your local Git project.
